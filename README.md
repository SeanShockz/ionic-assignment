#Calorific : Calorie Counter

Sean Shaughnessy - G00244904

This is an application that allows a user to keep track of their daily intake of calories. 
It is designed with the use of a list card that contains each individual item.
Each item is made up of an avatar showing a picture of the item as well as a quick note stating how many calories are in a portion.
Below each item is a button which adds the specified number of calories to the total label at the top of the page.
This total number can then be cleared by pressing the reset button.
